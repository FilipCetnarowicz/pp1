#in for loop, count every value how many times it occurs. If more than 1<gpt - if it is more than 1, then it is, and i add 
#later only those that are not at all, soo it is enough->> and not in new array- add (append) to new array.
#from GPT:
#convert to set (no duplicates in this variable)
arr1=[2, 3, 2, 5, 8, 1, 9, 8]
set1=set(arr1)
arr2=list(set1)
print(arr2)
